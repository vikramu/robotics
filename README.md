The project idea is "approach the football, position and kick".

Here I am assuming that the ball stopped rolling or fixed at one position.

I am planning to implement this with ROS2 and python.

Project Statement - Simulate robot to approach the football, position well and kick towards the goal post, application based in ROS2

Constraint - We simulate as we do not have access to physical robot

The original intention to create this project in python but due to the issues with the motion manager, vision manager in Python this whole project is moved away from Python to C++.

Finally, the working code is available
