The project idea is "approach the football, position and kick".

Here I am assuming that the ball stopped rolling or fixed at one position.

I am planning to implement this with ROS2 and python.

Project Statement - Simulate robot to approach the football, position well and kick towards the goal post, application based in ROS2

Constraint - We simulate as we do not have access to physical robot
